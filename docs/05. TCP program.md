#### TCP program

The block bellow is the part of the library that link queries to one particular modbus-tcp-device. 

```pascal
#mb_client_ctrl(interface := "Local~PROFINET_interface_1", 
                conn_id := 1, 
                ip_addr := _array_of_byte_in_,
                tcp_port := 502,
                timeout := T#1S,
                error => _bool_out_ ,
                mb_query := #mb_query);

// mb_delay, this function will halt the execution for a certain amount of 
// time. This is useful in modbus tcp, so the client doesn't jam a network.
#mb_delay(delay := T#2s, mb_query := #mb_query);

#mb_query(...)
#mb_query(...)
...
```

- Remember to set long enough timeout, setting up a tcp-connection may take longer then the queries. For ip-packets that need to be routed there is also need for extra long timeouts.
- S7-1200 PLC's has only 8 tcp-connections available.
- Make sure that conn_id is unique for all tcp connection in the plc.

#### Advanced parameters

- #mb_client_ctrl.client.Blocked_Proc_Timeout
- #mb_client_ctrl.client.MB_Transaction_ID   
- #mb_client_ctrl.conf.retries
- #mb_client_ctrl.conf.disconnect

#### Save memory

If the library is only used for tcp then all blocks related to rtu can be removed to save memory.

- mb_master_1200_ctrl 
- mb_master_1500_ctrl 
- mb_internal_b 
- mb_internal_h
- mb_internal_f
