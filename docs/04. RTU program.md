### RTU program

The first block bellow is part of the library that link the physical hardware to the queries for one particular rtu-bus.

```pascal
#mb_master_ctrl(hardware_id := "Local~CB_1241_(RS485)", 
                operating_mode := 4, // 4 => RS-485 (Only mb_master_1500_ctrl)
                baud := 19200,  
                timeout := T#0ms, // 0 => auto
                error => _bool_out_ ,
                mb_query := #mb_query );
                
#mb_query(...);
#mb_query(...);
```

There should be one "mb_master_xxxx_ctrl" for each bus. All queries bellonging to one "ctrl" need to be called in the same order at each plc scan. This implies they need to be called from the same OB.

- Even parity is default, according to the modbus specification. If for some reason this need to be change it can be done with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity
- Timeout is calculated automatically according to the baud rate, but not according to telegram length and the number of repeaters. The timeout can be ajusted with: #mb_master_ctrl.conf.timeout
- hardware_id, the id for one RS-485 or RS-232 module.
- If the library is imported in to a S7-1500 PLC, the mb_master_1200_ctrl block generate a lot of errors, delete the block to get rid of them.
- If the mb_master_1500_ctrl is used, then remember set the operation_mode input parameter: 0=>RS-232 ; 1-3=>RS-422 ; 4=>RS-485 (default)

#### Advanced parameters:   
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.FLOW_CTRL   
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_OFF_DLY
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.RTS_ON_DLY
- #mb_master_ctrl.comm_load.ICHAR_GAP
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.Blocked_Proc_Timeout
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.EXTENDED_ADDRESSING
- #mb_master_ctrl.master.BLOCKED_PROC_TIMEOUT
- #mb_master_ctrl.conf.retries
- #mb_master_ctrl.conf.parity

#### Same memory

There are two blocks for modbus rtu, one S7-1200 and one other for S7-1500, delete the one that is not used. Also if the library is only used for rtu then all blocks related to tcp can be removed to save memory. 

- mb_master_1200_ctrl OR mb_master_1500_ctrl 
- mb_client_ctrl
- mb_delay
